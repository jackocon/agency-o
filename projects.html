                <h3>Sharper! Conference</h3>
                <p>We were approached by Family church with the opportunity to design and build out all of the elements for their upcoming Sharper! Conference website. They desired a look that would be cutting edge while also representing a church event for building up the leadership of other churches. We allowed the name of the conference, Sharper, to influence the logo and overall branding for all the designed elements. Upon visiting the site we wanted the user to know immediately who the conference is geared towards and when it takes place. We used a one page site structure to create a very obvious hierarchy of information, while including two secondary pages with more detailed information. This site was designed with a mobile first approach, creating a responsive webpage experience from small phones through large desktop displays. Through developing this site from the ground up we were able to optimize all aspects and keep the page load time under two seconds.</p>

                  <h3>Family Easter Weekend</h3>
                  <p>The Family Easter Weekend approached us to design and develop their branding and website for an Easter event. The design focused around aspects of the Easter holiday with a focus on relaxation, reconnecting, and renewal. In initial interviews with the client he really stressed wanting a rustic feel throughout the event. We let the rustic feel really drive the logo and branding. With a mobile first design approach we achieved a responsive design.</p>
